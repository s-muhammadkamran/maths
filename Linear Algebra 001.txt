Concepts:
=========

For us humans it's not possible to visualize beyond 3 dimensions.
Linear Algebra let us represent, manipulate and compute higher dimensions data 
in mathematical format or numbers using structures like.

Scalars
Vectors
Matrices
Tensors

Other Concepts:
===============

Operations on Matrices (Arithmatic Operation)
Linear Transformation
Eigen Value
Eigen Vectors
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
Numerosity Reduction
Regression
Gradient Descend
Prediction
Classification
Forward & Backward Propogation in Neural Networks
[f1 f2] * [[w1 w2 w3] [w4 w5 w6]] = Matrix Multiplication

Important Application of Linear Algebra for CS and DS:
======================================================
Machine Learning & AI
Model Training

Predictors/Features/X = (Area, No Of Rooms, Floors, Location) >>>>
[House Price Prediction Model] >>>> Predictions/OutCome/Y = (Price)

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning

Computer Graphics: Like Image Processing / Transformation
Every image is a matrix of RGB pixels can be represented as numbers.

Optimization:
